A repo to keep track of my exercise progress.

Uses data that I keep track of in Google Sheets to practice stats and visualizations.

It also includes a shiny app, "shinyR_1rm_warmup_sets", which calculates your potential one rep max based on previous sets (weight and reps) and automatically generates a warm-up set for a one rep max attempt.
